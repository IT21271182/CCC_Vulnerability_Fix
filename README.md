* **Secure Authentication with Google OAuth:** OAuth 2.0 integration using Google Sign-In for user authentication.
* **Project and User Management:** Easy management of coding projects and team members.  

## Changes 
### Google OAuth Integration:
To enhance security and simplify the login experience, the application now supports Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Users can sign in using their Google accounts, ensuring a secure and efficient login process. This reduces the need for handling sensitive user credentials on the platform.

### Security Enhancements:
